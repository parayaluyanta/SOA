```
Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, 
usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. 

Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors 
as quickly as possible.

Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all types—including new features,

safely and quickly in a sustainable way.
